 Project Description

This project is a simple Student Management System developed in Java.
It allows users to manage students, courses, and enrollments using basic OOP concepts and collections.

 Features

1. Student Management

- Add student details (ID, Name, Email)
- View all students

2. Course Management

- Add course details (Course ID, Name, Fee)
- View all courses

3. Enrollment System

- Enroll a student in one or more courses
- Uses HashMap and ArrayList
- Prevents duplicate enrollment

4. Menu Driven Program

- User-friendly menu options
- Continuous execution using loop

---

 Advanced Features

5. Exception Handling

- Handles invalid input using "try-catch"
- Custom exception ("InvalidDataException") implemented

6. Multithreading

- Simulates enrollment processing using "Thread"
- Adds delay to show real-time processing

7. File Handling (Bonus)

- Save student data to file ("students.txt")
- Read and display data from file

---
